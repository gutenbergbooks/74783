<h1 class="fs150 lsp noindent center">BOYNTON BICYCLE RAILWAY SYSTEM.</h1>
<hr>
</div>

<p class="drop-cap">The thirty pound bicycle has safely carried ten times its weight. A man has in one day propelled himself and
his machine <em>five hundred and fifteen miles</em>. The principle of the bicycle, saving enormously in weight and
friction, is here presented for application to existing and to future steam and electric roads without change
of gauge or interference with existing trains.</p>

<p>Turn a plank up edge-wise and it will carry many-fold greater load than it would flat-wise: so by constructing two-story
cars, about four feet wide and fourteen feet deep, greatly increased strength and lightness may be secured.</p>

<p>The cellular construction of the bamboo makes it extremely light and yet strong; so it is with the Bicycle car, constructed
with veneer and steel, and composed of eighteen separate compartments corresponding to the cells of the
bamboo.</p>

<p>It is the aim of this invention to reduce the undulations and friction of a car in motion, thereby largely increasing
safety and speed, and saving wear and tear on both rolling stock and track.</p>

<p>Engines are now required to drive from four to eight wheels held in line back of the cylinders. On rounding
curves the framing is strained by friction and wedging, entailing a large loss of power. The wheels, rails, and cars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">[Pg 2]</span>
throughout suffer proportionately from grinding and shearing. The Bicycle engine, with its double-flanged wheels,
follows any curve with a small loss of power.</p>

<p>One or more driving-wheels running on a single rail is the simplest of all means of transportation; so manifest is it
that the U. S. Patent Examiner, in charge of the railroad department, writing to the Hon. E. M. Boynton, the inventor,
calls it “a practical solution of the problem of increased rate of speed—simple, inexpensive, practical.”</p>

<p>A driving-wheel six feet in diameter can doubtless be made to run a Bicycle locomotive one hundred to one hundred
and twenty miles an hour with short stroke engines, and double the number of revolutions they now make, its
speed being limited only by friction and air pressure. Ninety miles an hour, however, would probably for the
present satisfy all reasonable wants for express trains, and a proportionately lower rate of speed for local and
freight trains.</p>

<p>The overhead guiding beam is set inward, on curves, tipping the train toward the center of the curve, thus
counteracting the centrifugal force, like a bicycle.</p>

<p>Practice has demonstrated that the twenty-two ton Bicycle locomotive is so truly balanced, that when running
on a tangent, the upper horizontal bearing-wheels seldom touch the overhead guide beam, an inch space
being left between them; and it is found that even when running on curves, at high rates of speed, as the train
is made to lean inward to balance the centrifugal force, the friction of the overhead or guiding-wheels is but
trifling.</p>

<p>The <cite>Engineering News</cite> of March 2, 1889, says:</p>

<p>“That the motion of a train running on a single rail in this manner might be very much smoother and
safer, seems to us reasonable, or at least a chance worth thorough investigation. It is a wholly different matter
from narrowing the gauge. So long as the reliance for stability is on the support of a pair of rails (the center
of gravity falling between them), all narrowing of gauge must be a disadvantage; and as it is impossible to
maintain a pair of rails exactly horizontal, there must inevitably be a jerking of the train from side to side,
which, at high speed, becomes exceedingly dangerous; because, whenever the level is not perfect, there is a
tendency created to lateral impact against one rail or the other. In bicycle motion all this tendency is eliminated.
There is nothing but the forward motion to maintain perpendicularity in the vehicles (except when the
top guard-rail comes by accident into action), nor is anything more needed. Hence there is only the vertical
irregularities of the rail to be taken into account; and even if they should cause considerable bouncing at points,
it is directly up and down, without tendency to cause lateral motion, the center of gravity being directly over
the point of support tending, unaided, to stay there.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a>
    Taking into account this great potential advantage and
the smaller cross-section of the train, it appears reasonable that a much higher rate of speed may be safely
maintained than is either possible or safe with double-rail vehicles.”</p>

<p>Comparing weight to work done, about one ton of train weight is now required to convey a passenger,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">[4]</span>
and the average freight train, empty, weighs more than the paying freight carried by it; whereas it is practicable
for the Bicycle trains to be made to carry more than five times their own weight without five-fold loss of
wasteful friction, thus affecting a saving of at least ten-fold in freight, and twenty-fold on passenger trains. The
Bicycle cars already built, seat 108 passengers, and weigh complete only five tons.</p>

<hr>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">The peculiar construction of the two-story Bicycle cars, four feet wide, fourteen feet deep, and forty-two feet
long, shaped like a plank turned edge-wise, makes them many fold lighter and stronger.</p>

<p>Speed and economy of transportation with reduced cost of construction.</p>

<p>A great saving of expense in grading and land damages.</p>

<p>A greater proportion of paying to non-paying load by the use of narrow two-story deep cars.</p>

<p>A great reduction in cost and wear of rolling stock.</p>

<p>A large saving of friction in rounding curves by the substitution of Bicycle spindles for ordinary car wheel
axles, and consequent economy of power in moving trains, and a rate of speed more than double that heretofore
obtained on railways, with comfort to passengers, and economy in the conveyance of freight.</p>

<p>Greater safety; as a train grooved between an upper support and lower rail renders any derailment impossible,
and the train must run true, smooth and safe.</p>

<p>Spreading of rails by this system will be entirely unknown, the weight being centralized on the rail, both
on a curve and a tangent.</p>

<p>A many-fold saving in the consumption of fuel, as the weight of cars drawn would be about one-sixth the
weight of the ordinary cars, and the seating capacity double.</p>

<p>The two-story cars of this system are 14 feet in depth, 42 feet long, leaving 6½ feet in the clear for each
series of compartments, and are reached in loading and unloading by two-story platforms in the depots and spiral
staircases at the end of such cars as may be thought desirable on through trains. The material of which the
car is constructed is wood veneer, held in place by steel bands and rods. The cars now in use have nine compartments
below and nine above, each room having seating capacity for six people, face to face, seated as in
a hack, 108 seats in a car. This cellular construction, like the bamboo, insures great strength and lightness. A<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">[6]</span>
triple band of steel encircles the car lengthwise. At the top, center and bottom, ten bands of steel encircle the
car vertically opposite each division wall of the compartment, which practically divides the car from top to bottom.
Eighty-eight steel rods run through between the seats across the car, the ends being in the steel frame,
and thus draw the whole solidly together. The corners of the car, being covered with steel, are protected, and
the strength and lightness are unsurpassed. Thus one hundred pounds is made to do the work which requires
ten hundred to thirty hundred pounds in the old-fashioned heavy two-rail car.</p>

<p>There are eighteen doors on each side of the car, making thirty-six in all.</p>

<p>The veneer of which the car is constructed is three thicknesses of one-eighth of an inch each, with grain
of inner layer running opposite to that of outer layers. The seats are of thin veneer running across the car, two in
each compartment. This car will seat 108 persons and weighs a little less than five tons.</p>

<p>At the top of the car, as shown in illustration on page <a href="#Page_9">9</a>, are the bolsters holding the trolley wheels which
support it in an upright position. On each end, and supporting the car, are trucks which swivel the same as
ordinary car trucks, and are supplied with wheels forty inches in diameter. These wheels are constructed of the
best quality of steel, light and yet very strong. Spiral springs are used in cushioning the motion of the car,
and are placed in the bolster directly under the center of the car.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="MOTION_OF_THE_BICYCLE_CAR_AS_COMPARED_WITH_STANDARD">MOTION OF THE BICYCLE CAR AS COMPARED WITH STANDARD
GAUGE CARS.</h2>
<hr>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">The spiral springs placed in the center of the Bicycle car allow only a vertical motion, whereas the ordinary
standard gauge cars, from their width and the arrangement of their springs, allow an extreme
swaying motion, which in a long journey becomes very trying, and to a great many persons is the
cause of “sea-sickness.”</p>

<p>When a Bicycle car is rounding even very sharp curves, and at a rapid rate of speed, the swaying motion
or tendency to throw the occupant laterally, is very slight and can scarcely be felt. The reason for this
is obvious, as the Bicycle car is held rigidly, so far as any lateral motion is concerned, but tilts naturally to the
right or left according to the direction of the curve.</p>

<p>With these cars it has also been found, that the greater the speed the smoother they run, providing the
rail itself, upon which the cars run, is true. But supposing for the sake of argument that the rail is not smooth
or true, even the uninitiated can readily see, that the Bicycle car having only half the number of wheels, meets
only one-half the inequalities of the rail, and wherever these occur, cause only a vertical motion, whereas the
standard gauge cars have both the lateral and vertical motion, in consequence of being let down first on one side
and then on the other.</p>

<p>As we have already shown, the Bicycle car is absolutely controlled by the overhead structure, both from
any tendency to bound or leave the track in any possible manner; in fact by its momentum it is also self supported,
like the bicycle, causing only a slight strain on the structure, even when maintaining a high rate of speed.
This being a fact it can readily be seen that the side motion of the car could not in any case be great, and
a speed of even 100 miles an hour could be maintained without inconvenience to passengers.</p>

<p>It has frequently been asked, could a person breathe going at that rate of speed? It is not necessary to
say he could, as we are constantly traveling over 1,000 miles per hour, without suffering any inconvenience, as
in either case the atmosphere is carried with us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">[8]</span></p>

<p>And again:—What would be the effect if a number of people were seated on one side of the car? Would
it not throw it out of balance?</p>

<p>These narrow cars bring the weight of the passengers on one side within one foot of the center, the height
being fifteen feet, the side strain overhead would be one-fifteenth of the weight of the highest number of passengers
(36) possible to be seated on one side, and would only be about 75 pounds on each of the four overhead
trolley wheels. This would only be a trifle, as they are constructed to carry from two to five tons weight. This
is an extreme case, however, as the cars ordinarily would be about evenly balanced.</p>

OF EVERY DOUBLE.</h2>
<hr>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">The illustration on the opposite <a href="#Page_9">page</a> shows how this is accomplished. On the side of the structure where
the Bicycle trains are shown, we have an ordinary standard gauge, four feet eight and one-half inches.
This gives us four feet and eleven inches from center to center of each rail, and as shown, with cars four
feet wide, we have eleven inches between trains. This is ample.</p>

<p>On places were the curvature is considerable, cars could be made still narrower to accommodate four in
each compartment instead of six, and to allow more space to clear one another in rounding curves where the
overhang is considerable.</p>

<p>On such a road as shown here, two rails could be used for through express trains solely, with no possible
interference, and every opportunity would be given for a very high rate of speed.</p>

<p>The value of such a line to business men would be incalculable, giving them a rapid, comfortable and safe
transit, and at one-third the cost to railroad companies of the present so-called express trains.</p>

<p>Any business man, to whom time is valuable, would pay almost any price to reach the various places in order
to facilitate his numerous business transactions.</p>

<p>The other two lines could be used for local passenger traffic and the carrying of freight.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="COST_AND_ADVANTAGES_OF_UPPER_STRUCTURE">COST AND ADVANTAGES OF UPPER STRUCTURE.</h2>
<hr>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">The cost of changing an ordinary double-track road, with wooden structure similar to that illustrated on
page <a href="#Page_9">9</a>, would depend on the price of timber in the locality where the change was to be made. A
wooden structure would in many cases be sufficient, provided it were made of the proper strength, and
would last a great many years with a very slight cost for repairs.</p>

<p>On these structures could also be carried the numerous telegraph and telephone wires, and with suitable
wire on the sides would furnish fencing, which is necessary to keep the track clear from cattle and other obstructions.</p>

<p>It will be noticed that the cross timber, upon which the rail rests, is bolted to and forms a part of the
upper structure, so that from no cause whatever could the rail settle, allowing the train to drop out, but in any
case the structure and track must settle together. In a structure of this description, posts would be required
to be set from twenty to thirty feet apart, and the longitudinal guide-beams would be trussed together, making
them very stiff and strong.</p>

<p>It must always be borne in mind that the strain on these structures would be but slight, either on tangent
or on curves, and yet the structure should have sufficient strength to keep the overhead guide-beams true, so
that the supporting and the upper guide-rail both are in the same vertical plan.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">[12]</span></p>

<p>According to the Bicycle principle, the Bicycle cars would be able to keep themselves in an upright position,
while in motion, without any assistance of the upper guide-beam; but to quote the <cite>Engineering News</cite>, “Of
course as stability depends on the existence of rapid forward motion, and that motion ceases at stations, and is
liable to have to cease at any moment from accidental causes, provision must be continuously made by overhead
rail and guide-wheels, or otherwise, for support in case of need. Otherwise if the vehicles stop, they will at once
tip over. But a provision of this kind, which is only called into action in case of stoppage or sudden casualty,
is one thing: an overhead rail which is continuously relied on for support is another and quite a different thing.
In the latter case, the conditions might not be more favorable for smooth motion than on the ordinary double-track
rail. In the former case, the top guiding-wheels need not be in contact with the overhead rail at all,
except at stations, and hence there is much less necessity for exact construction or great strength or durability,
and the evident possibility of maintaining much higher speed with smooth motion, because, the faster the speed
the stronger should be the forces tending to maintain vertically, if the Bicycle principle be, in fact, capable of
such extension, and the action of these forces is perfectly smooth and uniform.”</p>

<p>After a year’s constant use on the Coney Island road, with a wooden structure which was only put up for
temporary use, the effect on the guide-beam was hardly perceptible. We have run on this road over 7,000 trips,
or about 25,000 miles, and the rubber bands on the trolley wheels of the cars are not worn at all. These facts
will bear investigation, and certainly ought to show conclusively the amount of overhead strain on the structure,
as the road is full of sharp curves, and the effect of the strain should be apparent here if anywhere. Note Mr.
Pond’s letter.</p>

<blockquote>
<p class="noindent">
“<span class="smcap">Hon. E. M. Boynton</span>, President Bicycle Railway Co.,<br>
32 Nassau Street, N. Y.<br>
</p>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—I wrote you on the allowance of patents on your Bicycle Railway System as follows:</p>

<p>“‘It presents, I think, a practical solution of the problem of increased rate of speed, as also of the problem
of an increase of the ratio of paying to non-paying load, whether in freight or in passenger traffic.</p>

<p>“‘I think both these results are altogether feasible, and are rendered so by the system you propose, which
is simple, inexpensive and practical.’</p>

<p>“After my ride of Saturday last on your road, I will add, that I regard the predicted success as mechanically
and practically accomplished. Upon careful examination, I believe the conditions to be more favorable to safety
at a very high speed than in the standard road.</p>

<p>“The whole catalogue of risks arising from ‘spreading’ of the track is eliminated from railroading by this system.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">[13]</span></p>

<p>“The freedom from lateral oscillation at high speed—at any speed—is remarkable, but very easily explained.
Accustomed to write a great deal upon moving trains, I can write a steadier, smoother hand on this car than ever
on any other. The evident capability of very high speed is surprising. Ride upon the tender and watch the guide-wheels
aloft, and see for yourself how much the machine, when at high speed on a tangent, stands right up of itself,
‘bicycle fashion,’ and how little work is required of those same guide wheels; and, in short, to see the train
pass is to see the ‘poetry of motion.’</p>

<p>“It would seem that to run 100 trains, each of sufficient capacity to carry 100 persons a mile and three-quarters,
all on half a ton of coal, should attract the sharp attention of railroad people. Such a fact admits of
some astonishing deductions, but can probably be explained by the very great reduction of friction, and the reduction
of non-paying weight per passenger to be hauled, from six to thirty fold, which are realized in your system.
To be able withal to transform a single track standard road into a double track line, with more than a doubling of
capacity, is another startling and very tempting fact. I see no reason why your system should not, and every reason
why it should, be universally adopted by existing roads in the interest of speed, safety and economy.</p>

<hr>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">In a recent scientific review, the writer, while admitting advantages of the Bicycle System under ordinary circumstances,
says: “A high gale of wind striking against the sides of these two-story cars would press
them against the upper rail with a force which nothing could resist.” Our present location should have
given this matter the severest possible test, located as we are in close proximity to the ocean and exposed on
a trestle over a mile long and high above the level of the sea, where terrific gales of wind have swept against
the sides of the cars. We have as yet had no difficulty in keeping the track, and have failed to perceive any
signs of being carried away by this “irresistible force” of which he speaks; on the other hand, we would not
answer for the safety of a standard gauge train passing over the same place under like conditions, as instances
of locomotives being blown off the tracks and down embankments are authenticated. Certainly a gale of wind
which is strong enough to endanger Bicycle cars or structures, would carry the heaviest standard gauge train off
the track.</p>

<p>In the Bicycle System the trains as they pass along serve in a measure to ballast the structure at the very
point where the wind pressure blowing against the sides of the cars would have any effect.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">The possibilities of this system of railway construction are immense. Small feeding roads may
be built in sparsely settled districts, where the farmer of moderate means may build his
own roads, and transport his grain and produce to town with but a trifling cost. A road
sufficient for this purpose could be built for probably about two thousand dollars per mile, especially
in districts where timber is readily obtainable. This would be a great boon for farmers, as at present
some of their products scarcely pay for raising, and their only means of transportation to the large
towns is by horses and wagons.</p>

<p>A very light rail may be used in this description of railroad by placing longitudinal timber
underneath, which could be formed by a tree hewn or sawed on one side for the rail to rest on.
Passing underneath is the cross-timber placed at right angles, to the side of which supports for the
upper structure are fastened. Bicycle locomotives may be constructed weighing from two tons up to
any weight according to the load necessary to be drawn.</p>

<p>Where the surface is moderately level, longitudinal timbers may rest on the ground. From
their strength and stiffness the danger from washouts would be very little. These structures may be composed of
lighter or heavier timber, as it all depends upon the weight which they are required to carry.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">There are numerous places where the Bicycle System will commend itself, and where the necessity for the
construction of a standard gauge track becomes a very expensive operation, especially in mountainous
districts, where solid granite must be cut away in order to get the required space. The actual space
occupied on the surface for a Bicycle road, need only be enough to rest the supporting rail, where a standard gauge
road would require a great deal of expensive work to prepare a level surface the necessary width, upon which to
rest the ties. A longitudinal iron or wooden beam upon which to rest the rail is all that would be required for
the Bicycle line, thus bridging all inequalities, and saving greatly in expense.</p>

<p>And in addition, the ease with which its cars and engines may turn, render it especially applicable to such
places where sharp curves occur, in winding around mountain gorges. In such places the Bicycle road requires
a space only four and one-half feet in width for a single line, and for a double line about nine. In putting up the
structure the rock may be drilled, and slight iron supports fastened to it. Another advantage which is apparent
in case heavy grades are to be mounted, is that an arrangement could be constructed, which, by pressing against
the upper structure or overhead guiding-beam, would greatly increase traction.</p>

<p>Numerous narrow gauge roads now in operation in the West prove their advantage over the ordinary standard
gauge, in the saving of friction and the ease with which they turn sharp curves. No narrower gauge road than
the Bicycle can possibly be constructed, and, as narrowing the gauge decreases friction, surely we have the greatest
possible advantage over anything yet constructed. Its economy and simplicity is very superior. You can never
get less than a single wheel, or line of wheels, or less than a single rail to run upon.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="COLLISIONS_AND_THEIR_CAUSES">COLLISIONS AND THEIR CAUSES.</h2>
<hr>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">Railroad statistics show that the cost of operating and maintaining the present through express trains is
very great, as all other trains must be hurried through at a rate of speed that is neither wise nor economical,
in order to reach some particular point where these trains may be sided to allow the passage of
express trains. The result of all this is soon apparent on trains and road beds, entailing additional expense for
repairs, to say nothing of the danger attending this system of dodging. It is estimated that from fifty to sixty
per cent. of the accidents on railroads ensue from collisions, and this in spite of the most improved system of
signaling, numerous dispatching stations, and facilities for sending messages by telegraph.</p>

<p>Collisions occur, not so much from the speed of express trains, but from the various rates of speed of the
different trains. It is readily apparent that no collisions could occur where trains running in the same direction
maintain a uniform rate of speed. This cannot be, however, and therefore, in order to facilitate transportation,
more lines must be accessible to perform this with safety and economy.</p>

<p>With the Bicycle System this can be accomplished much cheaper than with any other, as we have
shown. As certain as it is that it costs ten times as much to move ten tons as it does one ton, it is just as
certain that a corresponding ratio of proportion between Bicycle and standard gauge trains must reduce the
cost of operation ten-fold, as they are one-fifth the weight and twice the seating capacity. When this is taken
into consideration, with the additional factor of safety, which is desirable above all else, surely the Bicycle
System should be entitled to great consideration.</p>

<p>Aside from the question of speed and safety, this system should commend itself to all railway managers
who have other than personal interests to serve, from the fact of the important bearing the question of economy
has upon it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">[22]</span></p>

<p>It may be asked if it is really true that the trains may be run on this system so much cheaper than any other,
and supposing the weight of trains are equal, could this high rate of speed be maintained? To this we say
emphatically, yes! Two things must be borne in mind, however; first, that in order to carry weight at a high
rate of speed, an additional expense must necessarily ensue, as much from the damage done on the road bed
and wear on rolling stock, as the actual consumption of fuel. Second, the amount of gain, providing the weight
of trains were equal, would be the actual friction saved by Bicycle trains, as we have shown, from the action of
the single wheels on the rail. That this would be considerable will not be questioned, and yet this is not all,
<em>Light cars may be run on this system at very high rates of speed with the greatest safety, and because they are light,
with wonderful economy.</em></p>

<p>May not cars of the same weight be run on standard gauge roads? It is impossible; as in running at any
considerable rate of speed, they would inevitably leave the rail; and from the tendency to lateral motion, and
also from the inequalities of the rail, they would be tossed up first on one side and then on the other. This
danger would be greatly increased from a light construction.</p>

<p>Not so with the Bicycle trains. Supposing from the inequalities of the rail these cars should bound, from
the fact of their having received a direct impelling motion in a vertical direction, they would not be thrown off,
but would fall back squarely on the rail. This would be the natural tendency, but in order to prevent any
possible chance of leaving the rail, the overhead structure is so gauged that the cars and locomotives cannot rise
far enough to clear the flanges of the wheels.</p>

<p>The present standard gauge cars must be constructed heavier in order to stand the great strain resulting
from their oscillating motion, and also from the fact that they are supported only from the base or platform of
the car.</p>

<p>With the Bicycle cars it is entirely different, as they have two points of support, top and bottom, and their
structure may be much lighter with safety.</p>

<p>So in summing up, we here present two all important factors which give us the greatest economy in railroad
transportation, viz.: saving of friction with the Bicycle wheels and spindles, and the reduction of dead
weight. Certainly every additional pound of weight drawn means a corresponding consumption of fuel.</p>

<p>The accompanying affidavit shows the coal consumption of the Bicycle engine No. 2, it having a traction
sufficient to move two hundred persons in Bicycle cars, over a grade not exceeding one hundred feet to the mile.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">[23]</span></p>

<blockquote>

<p>“From August 23d to September 23d inclusive, we have furnished the entire coal consumed by the Boynton
Bicycle Railway Company in running their engine No. 2 with train attached, their schedule including fifty trains
daily, both ways, one hundred in all, over one and three-quarter miles of road. They have kept steam continuously
and used some coal for other purposes, and the exact amount furnished and paid for in the ordinary
course of business, with no previous notice to us, has been 31,000 pounds for as many days of continuous steaming
in running trains with capacity of from one to three hundred passengers safely, successfully and at the highest
rate of speed known.</p>

<hr>

<p>This proves that a train of similar capacity can be run from New York to Boston and back with a coal
consumption of but one ton, where from fifteen to twenty tons are now consumed. A single Bicycle car has
usually been used, containing seats for one hundred and eight people, and at short intervals on the middle of
the road, this car has been run ninety miles per hour, with passengers on board. Having run seven thousand
trains, connecting with other lines selling through tickets, the safety, economy, and unquestioned success of this
System has been practically demonstrated. When we consider the enormous weight of a Pullman Palace car
(from eighty to ninety thousand pounds), which is equivalent to the weight of seven hundred passengers, we
question, why not carry the seven hundred passengers instead of their equivalent in unnecessary timber and iron.</p>

<p>The people of the United States have built and now sustain by their labor an investment of ten thousand
million dollars, on which an average interest is paid of about double that of Government three per cent. bonds,
and yet they cannot travel on these highways, constructed with such infinite toil and expense, unless they carry
from ten to twenty-fold the weight of each passenger when the seats are filled.</p>

<p>The rapid Bicycle trains will supersede this slow, wasteful system. An average speed of sixty-five miles
per hour will reach the Pacific coast from New York in two days. A speed of one hundred miles per hour
is readily obtainable by steam or electricity on the Bicycle plan.</p>

<hr>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">The illustration on the opposite <a href="#Page_25">page</a> describes our locomotive No. 1. It was built in Portland, Me., and
is probably the first Bicycle locomotive ever constructed. At the first public trial, which took place in
September, 1888, at Gravesend, L. I., were present some of the most prominent railroad men in the
country. Its capabilities for speed were satisfactorily demonstrated, but owing to the shortness of the road, no
especially high rate of speed was attained.</p>

<p>This machine weighs 23 tons. It has two 12 × 14 inch cylinders, and a driving-wheel 8 feet in diameter. It has
a traction of about 300 tons. There is no doubt that this machine could easily maintain a speed of 100 miles
an hour, drawing a train of Bicycle cars, with a seating capacity more than equal to that of the longest standard
gauge train.</p>

<p>The steaming capacity of the boiler has been found to be very great, and entirely adequate to perform
the work required of it. The extraordinary height of the fire-box, 6 feet from grade to crown sheet, forms a
natural combustion chamber, causing great economy in the consumption of fuel.</p>

<p>This machine was found to be heavier than was necessary for the Coney Island road, and locomotive
No. 2, a much lighter machine, is now used in its place.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">This locomotive was constructed at the same time as the No. 1, but not as an improvement over that machine,
its principal advantage being that it was so much lighter in weight. This was particularly advantageous
from the fact that we were using an old unused road not designed for heavy traffic, and with this light
machine we could attain a much greater speed with safety on this limited road than with the No. 1. It weighs
only nine tons, but by filling the tanks with coal and water the traction may be greatly increased. The driver is
6 feet in diameter. It has two cylinders 10 × 12 inches. The boiler is an upright containing 102 tubes.</p>

<p>This machine is capable of a speed of 90 miles an hour drawing three Bicycle cars, with seating <ins id="note-1" class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: accomodation">accommodation</ins>
for 300 people, and an average consumption of coal of one-half a ton per day.<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p>

<p>We have used this locomotive constantly since the 16th of August, 1890, and have made the regular run of the
road, one and three-quarter miles, in three minutes regularly. On special time trips, the same distance, in two and
a quarter minutes, including starting and stopping.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">On page <a href="#Page_31">31</a> we give an illustration of our switches. The standing vertical bar reaches from the tie or roadbed
to the top of upper structure, with a crank top and bottom, thus operating top guide-beam and
lower rail simultaneously. When full throw of the switch is made, the ends of the rail and guide-beam
are brought directly opposite, making the joints similar to the old stub switch. These switches are thrown
and locked the same as those now used. The length of the shifting guide-beam and lower rail is thirty feet.
The swing of the guide-beam is eighteen inches, while that of the rail is about six. The difference between
the two, twelve inches, gives the tilt to the car which facilitates the switching of cars or locomotives, leaning
them to the right or left, thus reducing friction. We have two in use on our Coney Island road and have had
no difficulty in switching our heaviest locomotive. Indeed the matter of switching <em>only appears</em> to be complicated,
whereas, in fact, it is very simple and safe. No contingency can possibly arise where these cars and
locomotives could not be switched.</p>

<hr>
</div>


<p class="drop-cap">In addition to the apparent advantages of the Bicycle System over all other surface roads, it is peculiarly adapted
to elevated roads in cities and suburbs. First, from the fact that a single line of rails is used, it is not
necessary to cover up a street entirely, thus blocking it up from daylight, as is now done in a great many
places, but Bicycle structures may be built as shown on page <a href="#Page_35">35</a>, where posts are set at curbs on each side of the
street, forming little or no obstruction to light.</p>

<p>Anything which tends to darken streets in front of property tends in a measure to depreciate the value of that
property, as stores and apartments will certainly not rent as readily as those which have the full advantage of daylight.
Of course the facilities of transportation to the different localities make up in a degree for this deprivation,
but, if the same end can be reached, and even greater means of transport, without this nuisance in our streets, can
be attained with the Bicycle System, it should certainly be entitled to an impartial consideration.</p>

<p>The Bicycle trains having one-third the weight of those now operated, will make less noise in rolling on the
rails, and as the power exerted to move them will be two-thirds less, there will be a corresponding reduction in
the noise of the exhaust.</p>

<p>Two Bicycle trains can be run on one set of posts, leaving ample room to pass each other, and they could also
be run as shown on page <a href="#Page_45">45</a>, on posts placed in the middle of the street with scarcely any obstruction
as far as light is concerned. Another enormous advantage is the economy with which the Bicycle structures
can be built. A Bicycle structure sufficient to accommodate two lines can be built for one-fifth of the cost of
the present elevated structures in New York City and Brooklyn. There should be something in the foregoing facts
which should set our railroad projectors thinking. The numerous advantages and tempting possibilities of this
system should cause its early adoption. Even the present elevated cars, which are comparatively light, are entirely
too heavy, and only increase the cost of their operation. Bicycle cars have been built weighing only five tons,
with a seating capacity for 108 people, more than twice the number these cars will seat. One-story Bicycle cars
may be built weighing about three and one-half tons and seating 54 people. These are facts, not theories. If we
must use elevated roads in our cities, why should we load them with unnecessary weight, entailing an expenditure
of enormous sums for iron structures heavy enough to bear their weight, when this can largely be avoided.</p>

<p>What can be done with the present elevated structures in order to secure rapid transit? Many schemes have
been advocated, but none so far which are practical, except through the expenditure of about $50,000,000. The
nearest approach to rapid transit we have yet attained is an average speed of ten miles an hour, and there are
some hours in the morning, and at night, when not even half the people can be seated, but the balance are packed
in like sardines in a box, obliged to stand up and hang on to straps for from one-half to three-quarters of an hour,
instead of receiving the accommodation for which they pay. Real rapid transit can be obtained but in one way.
Two more lines must be accessible for express trains. The Bicycle System will give these two extra lines without
change of gauge, and give four trains to the present two, with only the additional cost of the upper structure.
Illustration on page <a href="#Page_36">36</a> shows how this may be accomplished. The elevated structure would then have much less
weight to carry, and this change could be made without interfering with the operation of the present trains. A great
many people who ride on the elevated roads have ridden in the Bicycle cars on the Sea Beach and Brighton Road
at Coney Island, and can testify to the advantages of this system.</p>

<p>Another decided advantage in the Bicycle cars is their convenience in receiving and discharging passengers,
the doors, 36 in all, allowing instant exit. A car filled with 108 people can be emptied in a <ins id="note-2" class="corr" title="Transcriber's Note&mdash;original text: few seconds There">few seconds. There</ins>
is no need for argument to show
that 36 doors will allow emptying
and filling more quickly than two.
The difficulty of emptying a car
quickly, containing 80 or 90 people,
and obliging them to file through an
aisle, is well understood, as we have
all tried it, to say nothing of the inconvenience
of pushing one’s way
through a car, packed with standing
crowds, in order to get out at the
desired station. The delay at stations
to allow entrance and exit is
no inconsiderable obstacle to the
desired rapid transit, as the time
consumed is, on an average, nearly
what it takes to run from station to
station.</p>

<p>The Bicycle cars will obviate this
difficulty, giving every opportunity
for the saving of time at the stations,
which in making 40 or 50 stops is
considerable. The income of the
elevated railways may be greatly increased
and the expenses decreased,
and at the same time give the public
the much talked of and desired rapid
transit. There is every reason to
believe that the Bicycle express trains
could average 40 miles per hour on
the elevated railroad, making only
the most important stops, while local
trains could more than double the
present average rate of speed.</p>

<p class="drop-cap">In addition to the numerous advantages of the Bicycle System over all others, the substitution of electricity for
steam will greatly increase these advantages, and will show beyond a possibility of doubt that this system is
especially adapted for the utilization of this motive force, more than any other known.</p>

<p>The first, and perhaps the most important point in its favor, is the use of the overhead guide in which to enclose the
electric conductor. The advantages of this combination need hardly be specified, as they are evident to any one conversant
with the transmission of electric energy. One of the many difficulties inseparable from the present overhead
trolley system, is the proper insulation of the conductor, as it must expose a metallic surface for the transmission of the
current from the conductor to the trolley, and must evidently be left without any insulating cover whatever. It is therefore
not only at the mercy of anything that may come in contact with it, but is a constant menace to the safety of the public, as
many cases show, where accidents have resulted from telegraph wires coming in contact with electric power wires. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">[40]</span>
use of guard wires, to prevent these contacts, only partially obviates the difficulty, and certainly does not tend to make
the overhead trolley system popular. As the conductor is bare, it is exposed to all the evils arising from climatic changes,
such as ice, snow and rain, and the difficulties under such circumstances to insure a proper insulation from points of support
are very great, as at these points the presence of ice or other substances often causes a leakage of current.</p>

<p>Another difficult point is always to make contact with the conductor, as the latter is only supported at points some
distance apart and between these points is loose and yielding, and therefore not always a reliable medium for tapping the
current; the contact is not continuous, to say nothing of the liability of the trolley leaving it entirely. In forming curves,
as the wire can only be extended in a straight line from point to point, it necessarily demands a large and unsightly network
of wires; but even with this additional help to form the curves, it is impossible to pass these places at any rate of speed
except a comparatively slow one, on account of the tendency of the trolley to leave the wire.</p>

<p>These are some of the evils attending the electric trolley system, which are entirely obviated by the use of electricity
with the Bicycle System. Here the conductor is safely imbedded in the overhead guide, surrounded on all sides, except
the lower, with insulating material, and leaving only a narrow slot at the bottom of the guide-beam, through which the
trolley enters and makes contact with the conductor. The conductor of course conforms to the curves of the guide-beam,
and is therefore safely and rigidly supported, without any motion whatever in any direction; it being encased on top and
sides, is entirely protected from climatic changes and must always remain dry and clean. It is also evident that it is absolutely
impossible to make any accidental contact with any other conductor, or vice versa, or to imperil the lives of the
public in any possible manner. The conductor having a continuous support, and always being parallel with the supporting
rail, a safe contact under high rates of speed is insured, and as the guide-beam holding the conductor is readily
bent to conform to the curves, all difficulty in forming or rounding curves is eliminated. The slot in the guide-beam
forms a moderately deep groove, making it impossible for the trolley to get out, or to leave the conductor.<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Another
advantage of the Bicycle System is the proximity of the car top and upper guide, which necessitates only a very short
trolley arm instead of the long and cumbersome one now in use, with its large momentum, and consequent impossibility
of running at any considerable rate of speed. As the conductor is so safely insulated, it will certainly permit the transmission
of a much higher voltage, with its many advantages, without the risks to which the present electric roads are
subject.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">[41]</span></p>

  <figcaption class="caption"><p><em>Single Electric Bicycle Structure.</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">[42]</span></p>

<p>The foregoing are some of the many advantages which directly result from the use of the Bicycle System, but
there are others which result indirectly, and are perhaps fully as important.</p>

<figure class="figcenter illowp100" id="i_48" style="max-width: 26.6875em;">
  <img class="w100" src="images/i_48.jpg" alt="Safety shoe technical diagram.">
  <figcaption class="caption"><p><em>Sectional View of Bicycle Motor Car, showing Safety Shoe at Bottom of Car. Also Method of Suspending Car from
Springs at top of Motor Frame.</em></p></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>The difficulty with the present car motor is, that the power necessary to round sharp curves must be so much
greater at these curves than on a straight line, due to the width of gauge, and consequent grinding and wedging,
as well as the large rolling friction, that the motor must be constructed heavy and powerful enough to answer the
purpose in either case. The advantages of the Bicycle System in rounding curves, and reduced rolling friction, have
been described in former pages, and it should be very evident that a much lighter motor can be constructed, and with
light Bicycle Needle cars, will give a speed greater than anything yet attained. Another disadvantage of the present
heavy cars and motors, is the necessity of gearing the motor down to get power enough to start the car without burning
the armature out. The motor of our new electric locomotive contains but a single stationary shaft, with the armature and
wheel revolving on same, and in addition revolvable about a vertical axis enabling it to round curves. This supersedes
the intermediate shafts of the present gear motors, whose friction and liability to breakdowns render high speed impossible.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">[43]</span>
The Bicycle cars running so much easier, permit the coupling of the armature directly with the driving-shaft
without the necessity of intermediate gearing and all the evils connected with it. As the motor is in the car itself, it is
entirely free from all the dust and dirt to which those now used are exposed, and every part is constantly in full view, and
within easy reach of the engineer. Anyone conversant with the difficulties of supervising the present car motor and keeping
them clean and well regulated, will fully appreciate the benefits derived from this alone. It is obvious that the
outgoing and incoming currents could be sent through separate conductors in the overhead guide-beams, or if preferable,
the return current can be sent through the supporting rail.</p>

<p>Each car has its own motor, and is therefore entirely independent, thus facilitating switching or changing from one
track to another; it will also be possible to have the trains of almost any length, as each car furnishes its own traction
and as a greater number of passengers increases its traction, no adding of dead weight is necessary. With one locomotive
pulling a long train it is entirely different, as the adding of a number of cars is counteracting the traction of the former, and
must be equalized by a corresponding weight of the locomotive, thus furnishing a dead load of no benefit, and besides,
necessitating an increased motive force. In making up a train of these independent car motors, flexible electric connections
will enable the engineer in the front car to control all the motors, and thus operate the whole train.</p>

<p>Illustration on page <a href="#Page_45">45</a> describes the Bicycle electric car and the structure for an electric elevated road. The weight
of car and motor combined will only be about six tons. With this combination it is possible to maintain a very high rate
of speed. Certainly, without exceeding the number of revolutions already attained by electric motors, one hundred and
fifty miles an hour would be feasible. Experts have expressed the opinion that electricity is the coming motive power.
If this be a fact, as some of the recent electrical experiments seem to indicate, some system should be used which in all
cases would be entirely safe, as the public will certainly not patronize any which would imperil their lives or property.</p>

<p>The cars are furnished with a grooved metal keel at each end, inside of which the wheels are revolving, so that,
if from any possible cause one of the latter should break, the car would only drop far enough to allow this groove to slide
on the rail, but would not allow the guide-wheels to leave the overhead guide-beam.</p>

<p>Now, in regard to collisions, which are apt to occur from many causes, even where a separate line is furnished for
outgoing and incoming trains, unless some means are furnished to make such a contingency impossible. There is an
electric system at present in practical operation in Austria, where in case trains approach one another too near for safety,
a bell is set ringing in the engineer’s cab of the train following, which warns him of danger, and continues to ring until a
safe distance between the trains is established. A dial may also be arranged in the engineer’s cab, which will show the
position of every train and their relative distance from one another. Either one of these plans would remove all possibility
of collision.</p>

more than satisfied in regard to its feasibility and adaptability to quick transportation. By your single rail and
narrow cars you have lightened many-fold the weight of trains, and enlarged proportionally the carrying capacity
over steam roads, as at present existing, as you make a double-track road out of a single-standard gauge track.</p>

<p>I am fully satisfied as to its economical construction and working, its quick and rapid means of transit, and its
absolute safety in transporting passengers and freight.</p>

<p>I see no reason why it should not be universally adopted, as the tests of both the steam and electric methods
have proved its practical success.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">New York</span>, April 4, 1895.—A committee composed of members of the Senate and House of the Massachusetts
Legislature to-day inspected the Boynton Bicycle Electric Road from Patchogue to Bellport, Long Island. The party
entered a train at Patchogue at about noon, and shortly afterward were traveling around sharp curves and up steep
grades at the rate of nearly a mile a minute, almost totally unconscious of the rapid rate at which they were going.</p>

<p>The results of to-day’s examination are thus summarized by a member of the committee: First, they are satisfied
the system saves half the weight per passenger carried; second, makes one rail do more work than two now do;
third, gives double the speed possible by any other system; fourth, is about one-quarter the expense to build, as
compared with elevated railroads; fifth, is perfectly safe, silent, dustless and doing double the work at half the usual cost.</p>

<p>The committee seemed especially delighted with the capability of the road in giving a double track on a single
post, thus solving the question of rapid transit in the narrow streets of Boston and its suburbs, where several charters
are pending. The visitors agreed that the Bicycle System was safe and less injurious to property than the trolley system.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—In regard to your request for an expression of opinion in relation to the practicability of the Boynton
Bicycle Railway, I have to say, that I think the system is thoroughly practicable; that the rolling stock can be economically
constructed, and much lighter per live load carried than the ordinary rolling stock of equal strength.</p>

<p>By reason of the center of gravity coming directly over the single supporting rail, there will not be that disagreeable
oscillation which takes place on the double-rail system, and which is so destructive to the rolling stock; and for this
reason a high rate of speed can be maintained with greater safety than on the present system.</p>

</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Dear Sir</span>:—In reply to your letter of the 3d inst., requesting our opinion as to the merits of the Boynton Bicycle
Railroad System, we beg leave to say that we believe the system possesses marked features of merit on the following
grounds:</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">[49]</span></p>

<p><em>First</em>; that a Bicycle railroad car, loaded with passengers, is much lighter than a loaded car of the same passenger
accommodation of the present type, and consequently possesses corresponding economy in the power required to drive
it at a given rate of speed.</p>

<p><em>Second</em>; that owing to the lightness of construction, electric motive power, sufficient for the attainment of high
speeds, can be applied to each car as an independent unit, instead of requiring a special electric or steam locomotive to
haul one or more cars, thus obtaining for high speed railroads all the flexibility and advantages of the trolley system,
as now employed in street passenger railroads.</p>

<p><em>Third</em>; cheapness in the construction of the car, the roadbed and track, particularly when electric locomotion is
employed, requiring an overhead structure.</p>

<p><em>Fourth</em>; the advantage possessed by your system, in changing over from the present steam road to the Bicycle
road, arising from the width of your car, which permits two cars to pass each other, on the ordinary 4′-8½″ track, thus
providing a double track road in the space now occupied for a single track.</p>

<p>My attention was first called to the Bicycle Railroad System, as developed by E. Moody Boynton, some two or
three years ago, and I have since, from a careful examination of its workings, satisfied myself of its superiority in several
respects to other methods of transportation. Its simplicity of construction and cheapness of operation have commended
it to my favorable consideration, and the running of the experimental trains at Coney Island, and Bellport, L. I., the
former by steam and the latter by electricity, have convinced me that its advantages are many fold.</p>

<p>The liability of accident appears to be at a minimum, and the questions connected with the cheapness of
construction, the economy in operation, the great speed of trains, and the comfort and safety of travel, appear to
be entirely solved by the employment of the Bicycle system.</p>
